      <td>Pétanque was created in 1907 in La Ciotat, France. It comes from an older game called jeu provençal, which required players to take a few steps before throwing. According to the story, a player with leg problems could not run, so the game was adapted to be played while standing still with both feet together. The name pétanque comes from the Provençal expression &ldquo;pèd tancat,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;feet together.&rdquo;</td>

      <td height="111">Petanca is played by throwing metal balls (boules) toward a small wooden ball called the jack on a flat dirt or gravel surface. Players stand inside a circle with both feet together and take turns throwing, trying to place their boule closer to the jack than their opponent&rsquo;s or to knock opponents&rsquo; boules away. The team whose boule is farthest from the jack must keep throwing until they get closer or run out of boules. When all boules are thrown, only one team scores points for each boule closer to the jack than the opponent&rsquo;s nearest one, and the game is usually played until a team reaches 13 points.</td>
