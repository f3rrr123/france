      <td>Napoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769 on the island of Corsica and rose from a modest background to become one of history’s most powerful leaders during the French Revolution. Trained as a military officer, he gained fame through successful campaigns in Italy and seized political power in 1799, later crowning himself Emperor of France in 1804. Napoleon reformed France through the Napoleonic Code, which established legal equality and influenced laws across Europe, while also building a vast empire through military conquest. His rule began to collapse after failed efforts to defeat Britain and the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, which weakened his army. Defeated by European coalitions, he was exiled, briefly returned to power in 1815, and was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo before being sent to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821, leaving a lasting political and legal legacy.<br>

      <td>Marie Curie's life and work are a testament to her pioneering spirit and dedication to science. Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, she was the daughter of a schoolteacher. Marie's early education was interrupted by the Polish national uprisings, but she continued her studies at the clandestine Flying University in Warsaw. She moved to Paris in 1891 to pursue higher education and met her future husband, Pierre Curie, who was a physicist. Together, they discovered polonium and radium, leading to their Nobel Prizes in 1903 and 1911, respectively. Marie Curie's work laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and chemistry, and she remains a symbol of scientific achievement and perseverance.</td>
      <td>Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel (1883–1971) was a French fashion designer who changed women’s fashion forever. She rejected tight corsets and fancy excess, introducing simple, comfortable, elegant styles. She made the little black dress, Chanel No. 5 perfume (1921), and the Chanel suit iconic. Her brand became a symbol of modern luxury and timeless style—and still is today.</td>
